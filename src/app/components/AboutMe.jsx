                Hi, I&apos;m Grace, a Frontend Developer with a flair for turning complex problems into elegant 
                solutions. My journey began at Lagos School of Programming (LASOP), where my stellar performance 
                earned me the responsibility of handling the school&apos;s website project. Not only did I 
                complete all tasks ahead of schedule, but this early success also fueled my passion for diving 
                into the world of open-source projects. <br /> <br />
                In these open-source journeys, I gained invaluable real-world experience, even leading a team 
                on one project. I specialize in React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Next JS, bringing a keen eye for 
                detail and a solid background in UI/UX design to every task. My belief in hands-on learning has 
                driven me to build a couple of personal projects, each one pushing my skills further.  <br /> <br />
                When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me making people smile, offering a helping hand, or 
                expanding my knowledge through reading. I also love to dance, it&apos;s my way of keeping life fun and dynamic. <br /> My ultimate goal is to become so proficient that I can code in my sleep, crafting
                innovative software solutions that help businesses thrive and make people smile.
                A funny story from my early days: during my first open-source project,  I was the greenest newbie fresh out of bootcamp,
                I was tasked with creating a PR. My initial reaction? &quot;What on God&apos;s green earth is a 
                PR?&quot; ðŸ˜‚ But, determined to succeed, I quickly learned the ropes and became known for my 
                prompt submissions, even earning a commendation from the project owner. <br />
                That&apos;s me - driven, detail-oriented, and always up for a challenge. Let&apos;s build 
                something amazing together!
            </p>

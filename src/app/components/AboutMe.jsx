                Hi, I'm Grace, a Frontend Developer with a knack for turning complex problems into
                elegant solutions. I graduated from the Lagos School of Programming (LASOP), where I was
                entrusted with the school's website project due to my stellar performance. Completing all
                tasks ahead of schedule, I then dove into the exciting world of open-source projects, gaining
                invaluable real-world experience and even leading a team on one of them.
                I specialize in React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Next JS. With a keen eye for detail and a
                solid background in UI/UX design, I bring both aesthetics and functionality to the forefront
                of my work. My belief in hands-on learning has driven me to build a couple of personal projects,
                each one pushing my skills further.
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me making people smile, offering a helping hand, or expanding my
                knowledge through reading. I also love to dance, it's my way of keeping life fun and dynamic. <br />
                My ultimate goal is to become so proficient that I can code in my sleep, building innovative
                software solutions that help businesses thrive and people smile.
                A funny story from my early days: during my first open-source project, I was the greenest newbie
                fresh out of bootcamp, my first task was to create a PR. My initial reaction? "What on God's green
                earth is a PR?" ðŸ˜‚ But, determined to succeed, I quickly learned the ropes and became known for
                my prompt submissions, even earning a commendation from the project owner.
                That's me - driven, detail-oriented, and always up for a challenge. Let's build something amazing
                together!.
            </p>
